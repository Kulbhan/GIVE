# GIVE
Hello Google, I have a idea, i call this GIVE* (Google Information Videos Exchange). This is a social media app, it's provide camunication via video. In this app share your opinion, thoughts, advice on trends with video.  Nowadays everyone wants to give their opinion as to what happened and what should happen?, but writing can't show with feeling.  Videos shows emotion, is understandable, saves time, is easy and shows the truth.   To give video opinion (positive or negative)on an event and also opinion on that opinion. which will communicate unlimited videos.  If I say in a line "Commenting on ongoing trends by videos.  "I Think" would be the most used word in 'GIVE'.
